		<h1>Back to Basics</h1>
		<p>
		People overcomplicate things. Especially on the web. If you want to create a personal website or blog these days, 
		there are so many products and services lining up to make the sale. There are site generators and blog formatters 
		and fancy templates and the list goes on. The web has gotten so complicated, and I think this has hurt it. That's 
		why I'm redoing my personal website and blog, going back to square one. Just plain old HTML.
		</p>
		<p>
		For now, I won't even be using vanilla CSS or Javascript. Just HTML, and only HTML. The reason the web has become 
		so bloated is because companies create tools to help make creating content on the web easier. But the truth is that 
		making a plain old school website is extremely easy, and anyone can do it. There's no coding involved! And with all 
		these tools and frameworks comes distractions and trackers and ads. You wouldn't even believe it if you know exactly 
		how websites are tracking you, but that's a story for another day. Sometimes in life, it's best to go back to square 
		one. Over time, I'll slowly add basic CSS and JS, but nothing too fancy.

		Minimalism is a growing lifestyle trend, so why not minimalism on the web?
